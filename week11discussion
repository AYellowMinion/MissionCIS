Objective: In this discussion assignment, we will explore the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and its relevance in real-world networking scenarios.

The goal is to deepen your understanding of the OSI model and how it influences data flow in practical applications.

Instructions:

OSI Model Discussion :Post a discussion about the OSI model. Explain the seven layers of the OSI model (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application).

Practical Use Case Example :Select a practical use case from a field of your interest (e.g., web browsing, email, online gaming, video streaming, remote file sharing) and describe how data flows through the OSI model in that scenario.

Use the OSI model to break down the process, layer by layer, and illustrate how it ensures successful data communication. Be sure to highlight the significance of each layer in your chosen use case.

Peer Interactions :Engage with at least one of your peers' posts, offering insights, asking questions, or sharing your thoughts on their selected use cases and explanations.
