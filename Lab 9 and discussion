Electronic commerce is the selling of goods and services by either business or private individuals through the internet. You can think of it as the typical shopping experience except its initialted and facilitated online.

Let's begin by discussing the fundamental concept of E-Commerce. What does E-Commerce mean to you, and how has it impacted the way businesses operate and consumers shop? Feel free to provide your perspective and any real-life examples that illustrate the essence of E-Commerce.

2. Types of E-Commerce with Examples:

Next, let's explore the different types of E-Commerce. Please elaborate on each of the following categories and provide examples to illustrate them:

Business-to-Business (B2B): How does B2B E-Commerce work, and what are some notable examples of B2B platforms or companies?
A business selling to another company or business instead of an individual. Usually entails larger quantities, greater specifications and longer lead times. An example in this case would be a hospital ordering plastic syringes from Beckson-Dickson for medical use.

Business-to-Consumer (B2C): What characterizes B2C E-Commerce, and can you share examples of well-known B2C businesses or websites?
A business selling directly to an individual, can be any quantity or of any scale or size. A simple example would be a hot sauce company that creates their hot sauces, bottles it and ships it directly to the customer.

Business-to-Government (B2G): Describe the dynamics of B2G E-Commerce and offer instances where this type of E-Commerce is prevalent.
A business that is selling its services or products to a govermental institution. Usually its work or product that is contracted out to a group, sometimes companies will compete to win the bid. A common example would be construction work or having PGE supply power to San Jose, although recently Santa Clara county now produces and supplies its own power to Santa Clara residents.

Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C): What is the nature of C2C E-Commerce, and do you have any personal experiences or examples of popular C2C platforms?
Consumer to consumer can be thought of as a farmers market/flea market styled selling except its online. There is no official business entity, its simply a private sale between two individuals. Commonly seen on Ebay, Craigslist or Facebook Market place, it can be direct or auctioned. 

Mobile Commerce (M-Commerce): How does M-Commerce differ from traditional E-Commerce, and can you name mobile apps or websites that exemplify M-Commerce practices?
Mobile commerce is different in the sense that its about conducting transctions through a mobile device rather than selling goods. I think one of the most integrated and developed M-Commerce app is WeChat, it has almost completely replaced cash and credit card as you can just scan your WeChat user and pay for any service or good through the app. Well known western examples would probably be Zelle, Venmo or ApplePay which are popular and easy to use.

Let's engage in a comprehensive discussion on these aspects of E-Commerce, share your insights and examples, and encourage constructive dialogue among your peers.
