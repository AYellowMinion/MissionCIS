		<i><p> Self Summary <p></i>
<hr>
		<p> My name is <b>Winston Ma</b>, I am 26 Years old and some hobbies I enjoy would be Coffee, Tea, long distance running and tech in general. I was introduced into coffee and tea at one of my jobs 
where the CEO came up to me and outright offered that if I can get the espresso machine running and the coffee tasting great, he'll have the company pay for any and all R&D coffee funds. So for the past 3 years, I have made coffee 
a hobby. Gradually I got into tea as well since I drink almost everyday at home and continue to expand my knowledge and palette. As for running, it became a simple, efficient exercise where you can almost turn your brain off and just
keep going. It is uncomfortable but when you hit the "second wind" point, running is almost meditative and you would be surprised how far you go when you don't track the time. Lastly for tech as a hobby, I enjoy almost anything tech but
the areas that interest me the most would be hardware such as computers, keyboards and soldering. </p>

		<u><p>Career Goals</p></u>
<hr>
		<p> As for career goals, I would like to get into a more tech heavy field, after all we do live in the silicon valley and the future lies in the advancement of technology. What I would do specifically or how I would reach 
these goals is another matter entirely and there is no real answer besides going out there and doing it. So by signing up for classes at Mission College, I intend to throw myself into the field and seeing what sticks and what doesn't. I
 What I hope to learn or acquire as I go into this field deeper would be to understand what each field in computer science is about and to work towards what draws my attention the most. I might deviate and explore around but I am confident
I should be able to figure out what I enjoy and what I find too confusing for me quickly. </p>

		<em><h3>Third paragraph about whatever</h3></em>
		 <h1> Taiwanese Brown Sugar Milk Tea </h1>
        <p> Arguably the gold standard for milk tea, some consider brown sugar milk tea to be the new default instead of Jasmine or Oolong but on the other hand it is slightly above average in price and is considered a luxurious upgrade for some.
        It may look or sound fancy but objectively looking at it, its just a normal milk tea with a brown sugar syrup. Asethically it looks nice but you can make a variant out of any fruit syrup, matcha, pandan or botanical. You can even go another step above and include flavored syrups or alcoholic drinks. I would say the only thing to avoid is mixing acid with dairy otherwise you will create buttermilk and curds, leading to a chunky drink. 
        This drink is primarily served cold so it is advised to make the tea ahead of time and let it cool to room temperature while you prepare your other ingredients. While you can pre chill your equipment and place ingredients in the fridge, do <strong> not </strong> place your prepared boba in the fridge, leave it submersed at room temperature in its honey-water mixture.
	I would strongly reccommend when making milk tea to always make it in large batches since you can brew large amounts with relative ease and you can always fridge the rest. If you were to run out or wanted to increase the batch, unfortunately you 
	have to always start from the beginning, you cannot add more milk or water as it would just dilute the taste and richness. Additionally, if you were to add a different brew of tea, the flavors may change due to brew time, concentration and etc.
